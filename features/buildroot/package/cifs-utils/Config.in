	  The in-kernel CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred
	  method for mounting SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. The in-kernel
	  CIFS filesystem relies on a set of user-space tools. That
	  package of tools is called cifs-utils. Although not really
	  part of Samba proper, these tools were originally part of
	  the Samba package. For several reasons, shipping these tools
	  as part of Samba was problematic and it was deemed better to
	  split them off into their own package.
