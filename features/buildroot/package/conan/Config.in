config CONAN_BUILD_POLICY_MISSING
	bool "missing"
    help
	  It will build only the missing requires.

config CONAN_BUILD_POLICY_OUTDATED
	bool "outdated"
	help
	  It will try to build from code if the binary is
	  not built with the current recipe or when missing binary package.

config CONAN_BUILD_POLICY_CASCADE
	bool "cascade"
	help
	  It will build from code all the nodes with some dependency being
	  built (for any reason). Can be used together with any other build
	  policy. Useful to make sure that any new change introduced in a
	  dependency is incorporated by building again the package.

config CONAN_BUILD_POLICY_ALWAYS
	bool "always"
	help
	  The always policy will retrieve the sources each time the package
	  is installed, so it can be useful for providing a “latest” mechanism
	  or ignoring the uploaded binary packages.

config CONAN_BUILD_POLICY_NEVER
	bool "never"
	help
	  Never build, use binary packages or fail if a binary package is not found.
