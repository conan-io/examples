	  The AllJoyn framework defines a common way for devices and
	  apps to communicate with one another regardless of brands,
	  categories, transports, and OSes. Developers write
	  applications that discover nearby devices, and communicate
	  with each other directly and through the cloud, unleashing
	  new possibilities in the Internet of Things.

	  AllJoyn Thin Core Library (AJTCL) is designed to bring the
	  benefits of the AllJoyn distributed programming environment
	  to embedded systems.
