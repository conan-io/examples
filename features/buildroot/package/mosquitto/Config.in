	  Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements
	  the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol versions 3.1 and
	  3.1.1. MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out
	  messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
	  suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as with low
	  power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded
	  computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
