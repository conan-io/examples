Example how to use Conan commands to develop a package recipe.

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/developing_packages/package_dev_flow.html

### [Workspace](features/workspace)

Example how to use Conan Workspaces.

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/developing_packages/workspaces.html

### [Editable Packages](features/editable)

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/developing_packages/editable_packages.html

### [Serializing your data with Protobuf](libraries/protobuf/serialization)

Demonstrate how to use Protobuf to serialize data between C++ and Python.

Blog Post: https://blog.conan.io/2019/03/06/Serializing-your-data-with-Protobuf.html

### [Using Facebook Folly with Conan](libraries/folly/basic)

Demonstrate how to use Folly to validate an URI using Futures, FBString, Executors, and Format.

Blog Post: https://blog.conan.io/2018/12/03/Using-Facebook-Folly-with-Conan.html

### [An introduction to Dear ImGui and how to use with Conan](libraries/dear-imgui/basic)

Demonstrate how to use Dear ImGui with Conan to add a GUI to an OpenGL3 application.

### [Exporting targets with CMake and reuse with find_package()](features/cmake/find_package/exported_targets_multiconfig)

Use CMake to declare, export and install the targets of some libraries and using Conan to reuse them with
``find_package`` and the multi-configuration project.

### [Using the cmake_find_package_multi generator](features/cmake/find_package/find_cmake_multi_generator_targets)

Demonstrate how to use the ``cmake_find_package_multi`` generator to integrate seamlessly CMake with Conan
using ``find_package`` in a multi-configuration project.


### [Multi-configuration package (N configs -> 1 package)](features/multi_config)

Example on how to create multi-configuration debug/release packages covering the N configs -> 1 package use case:

- Remove the ``build_type`` from settings.
- Have a CMake script that differentiate debug and release artifacts (``set_target_properties(hello PROPERTIES DEBUG_POSTFIX _d)``).
- Have a ``build()`` that builds both configs.
- Have a ``package_info()`` method that accounts for both configs ``self.cpp_info.debug.libs``, etc.

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/creating_packages/package_approaches.html#n-configs-1-package


### Lockfiles

#### [Using lockfiles in CI to rebuild a whole project](features/lockfiles/ci)

When a package in a dependency graph is modified and a new version or revision is created, it
is sometimes desired to test if that new version works well within a larger product or project,
that is, when that package is part of a larger dependency graph. The packages that depend on
the modified one might need to be rebuilt, but if something else changed, it is impossible to
achieve reproducible builds.

Using lockfiles can enforce the same upstream dependencies, to ensure reproducible builds and to re-build and test such scenarios.

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/versioning/lockfiles.html#how-to-use-lockfiles-in-ci

### [Integrate a build system in Conan](features/integrate_build_system)

Shows how to integrate a build-system in Conan using an *installer*, a *build-helper* and a *custom generator*.

### [Deployment](features/deployment)

Shows how to use conan ``json`` generator with custom script to automate the creation of deployable artifact ([makeself.io](https://makeself.io))

Documentation: https://docs.conan.io/en/laters/integrations/deployment.html
